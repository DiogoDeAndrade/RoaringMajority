# THE ROARING MAJORITY

Developed for [2026 Global Game Jam](https://globalgamejam.org/2026), with theme Mask, this project is a small experimental management/strategy game about crowds, protests, and identity. The core idea is to explore masks as both cosmetic and gameplay elements: anonymity, symbolism, protection, provocation.

The project is intentionally scoped to be solo‑dev friendly and fun to build within a tight jam timeframe, while still allowing expressive systemic play.

## Game

The player manages protests inside a city. Each person can wear a different mask (which symbolizes their role), affecting how they behave, how others react to them, and how situations escalate.

Gameplay alternates between:

- A macro view: deploying people to different locations in the city
- Close-up view: observing and influencing what happens on the ground (tension, clashes, negotiation, dispersal)
- HQ: control macro concepts like purchasing ads, or buying signage!

The challenge is to balance numbers, mask types, and intent, while reacting to police presence, counter-groups, and emergent chaos.
